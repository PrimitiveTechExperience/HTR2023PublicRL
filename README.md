All for the hacking of the ridge in the year of the 2023

Ryan L's Solo disaster project.

Note that most of this was tested using VSCode's Live Server extension,
so if there are any bugs (hopefully not, but who knows considering VSCode),
simply use the VSCode Live Server addon.

good luck for others, and git gud for those begging for more time (yall had about 12 hours in groups,
a true bruh moment).
