As detailed within the HTR 2023 requisites, we'll need to create a project that requires:
- "Retro styled GUI"

Ideas:
- Perhaps some sort of sythnwave-esque opening on website startup?
- Applications that could be included in the website:
    - Some sort of calculator?
    - Perhaps some games like snake or pong?
    - Maybe something like a sort of shopping website subdirectory
    - Grab some other things such as some sort of 80s feels for the shopping website
- Types of programs that could be used:
    - python's tkinter kit, pygame, maybe pyglet since pygame doesn't have vsync?
    - javascript is a must, so relearn some node.js, or other potnetial things
    - relearn html, css.
    - maybe some ai?

Main plan:
- Have a "on-start up" effect, such as a retro pacman opening or some sort of 80s "Synthwave" style esque thing
    - Check if synthwave is "retro" enough.
- To counter the "Uniqueness problem" while making an app that can have some real life applications,
    use a combination of a website grabber
